Hello, This discord bot was made in response to a moderator gone rogue on my personal server of 60+ members. 
Friends on my server enjoy creating copius amounts of roles with no perms just to label each other with funny 
categories and nick names etc. After mod abuse however, all roles were deleted meaning years of memories needed to be restored.
This bot was created to prevent future losses. The bot allows all users in the server to create roles and add other members to said roles
without allowing any dangerous actions like deleting roles or giving everyone admin powers.
To use this bot in your server, copy your bot token into the config file and run index.js
